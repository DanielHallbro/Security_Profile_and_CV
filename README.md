A standalone framework designed to automate the triage and analysis of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). This tool bridges the gap between raw threat data and actionable intelligence.

* **The Tool:** Automated real-time monitoring, binary hashing, and multi-source intelligence integration (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, IPinfo).

* **Skills Shown:**

    * **Advanced Python Scripting:** Implemented a modular architecture for scalability and real-time folder watching.
    * **API Integration:** Interacting with external security intelligence sources.
    * **Automation & Triage:** Streamlined security workflows by reducing manual investigation time.

Check out **[IOC Analyzer v1.0.0](https://github.com/DanielHallbro/Applied_Script_CS25_FSH/tree/main/IOC_Analyzer)** to see how this project evolved from a classroom script to a modular framework.
